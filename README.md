# Football-Betting-Model
This is an ongoing repository which aims to create a ML betting model for football results using Historical seasons to test a random forest estimator

Currently, the files show how the 6 most recent years of Premier League football results data has been scraped from FBref, combined with a downloaded file of all the betting company odds of these games. The following file then cleans and merges each of these datasets so that they will be ready for analysis.
